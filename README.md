[![Logo SendHerePlz](img/sendhereplz-logo-128.png)](img/sendhereplz-logo.png)

**Quick identification of Amazon products with shipping restrictions**

Have you ever spend hours looking for items on Amazon sites but none of them were available for shipping to your location? With this **browser extension** you will be able to detect these items quickly from the results page, so you can easily identify which products are eligible for you.

## Features

- Identify the non-eligible items (within the results page) because of shipping restrictions.
- Add a badge for each item (within the results page) which is only available through other sellers.
- It works with any Amazon site regardless of the language you use or the country you live in.

Note that:

- First item has a new badge below to indicate that it is only available from other sellers.
- Second item is shaded and it has a new icon since Amazon does not ship it to your location.
- Third item is kept as usual because it is fully eligible (in terms of shipping).

# Send here please!

This is a _Chrome Extension_ to identify non-eligible products on **Amazon** because they are not sent to some locations. In this case, we live at [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) and unfortunately there are a lot of Amazon products that they do not send here. Furthermore there is no choice to filter those products which are eligible.

> This extension provides a way to highlight and cross out the non-eligible products for sending reasons.

This project is a fork from the original _SendHerePlz_ project developed by Micael Mart√≠n ([@micaelcometa](https://github.com/micaelcometa)) at [Desarrollo Cometa](https://desarrollocometa.com):

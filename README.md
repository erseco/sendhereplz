[![Logo SendHerePlz](img/sendhereplz-logo-128.png)](img/sendhereplz-logo.png)

This is a **Chrome Extension** with one clear aim: **"Quick identification of Amazon products with shipping restrictions"**.

Have you ever spend hours looking for items on Amazon sites but none of them were available for shipping to your location? With this extension you will be able to detect these items quickly from the results page, so you can easily identify which products are eligible for you.

## Features

- Identify the non-eligible items (within the results page) because of shipping restrictions.
- Add a badge for each item (within the results page) which is only available through other sellers.
- It works with any Amazon site regardless of the language you use or the country you live in.

## Installation

### User mode

Just add it to your Chrome browser from [our page on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sendhereplz/anpeeogkdbgkhakjldceemkolhggobhd).

### Developer mode

- [Download](https://github.com/sdelquin/sendhereplz/archive/master.zip) the project.
- Uncompress the `.zip` file (a folder named `sendhereplz-master` is created).
- Place the folder where you want to keep it (write down this location).
- Open [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/es_es/chrome/) browser.
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` on navigation bar.
- Check the box for **Developer Mode** in the top right. (_"Modo desarrollador"_ in spanish)

Note that:

- First item has a new badge below to indicate that it is only available from other sellers.
- Second item is shaded and it has a new icon since Amazon does not ship it to your location.
- Third item is kept as usual because it is fully eligible (in terms of shipping).

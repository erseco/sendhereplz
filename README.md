[![Logo SendHerePlz](img/sendhereplz-logo-128.png)](img/sendhereplz-logo.png)

This is a **Chrome Extension** with one clear aim: **"Highlight non-eligible Amazon items because of shipment reasons"**.

Have you ever spend hours looking for items on Amazon sites but none of them were available for shipment to your location? With this extension you will be able to detect these items from the results page, so you can easily identify which products are eligible for you.

## Features

- Highlight and cross out the non-eligible items (within the results page) because of shipment reasons.
- Add a badge for each item (within the results page) which is only available through other sellers.
- It works with any Amazon site regardless of the language you use.

Note that:

- First item is crossed out because Amazon does not ship it to your location.
- Second item is kept as usual because it is fully eligible (in terms of shipment).
- Third item has a new badge below to indicate that it is only available for other sellers.
